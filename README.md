# MIPS_Pipeline

Building an enhanced MIPS emulator with 5 pipeline stages by concurrently executing multiple instructions at the same time. In a five stage pipeline, instructions are processed in five distinct stages (or pipeline stages) those are IF (Instruction Fetch), ID (Instruction Decode), EX (Execute Operation), MEM (Access Memory Operand) and WB (Write Back). In a pipeline processor, an instruction is processed with multiple cpu clock cycles. In addition to multi cycle execution, in a pipeline processor, the execution of different instructions are overlapped and five different instructions can be executed at the same time.
